About Me: I am an Assistant Teaching Professor in the [Geology Department](https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/geology/faculty-staff/faculty.host.html/content/shared/arts-sciences/geology/new-faculty-profiles/boyle-james.html) at the University at Buffalo and grew up in the southtowns. I am the department's resident paleontologist with an interest in extinction dynamics and paleobiology of graptolites and arthrodire placoderms of the lower Paleozoic.
