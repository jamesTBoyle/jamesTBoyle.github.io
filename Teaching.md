# Teaching Philosophy
Ultimately, I approach teaching with the attitude that students are adults and will be treated as such. I understand that as adults most students have many different responsibilities pulling on their limited time and that any single class is unlikely to be, and probably should not be, the highest priority in their lives. Starting from that position I will respect student's decisions on what they do with their time and expect the same respect in kind from the effort I, and their fellow students, put into the class. 
For my part I will be as clear as possible on what is expected in the course right from the start and if any of those conditons change they wil be relayed to the whole class as quickly as possible. This then means that students are fully responsible for their own decisions on preparing for tests, meaning deadlines, and showing up to class. If they have other responsiblities that they think their time will be better spent doing than attending class that's fine but the consequences in terms of grades and content should be crystal clear.
